Candy Machine User Interface Setup Guide
Introduction

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for configuring the user interface (UI) of your Candy Machine, which facilitates NFT minting using the SPL token you've created. Users will mint NFTs through their Phantom wallets.
Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

    A configured Candy Machine with specific details in the config.json file, including price, quantity, symbol, seller fee basis points, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator information.
    A Phantom wallet set up for minting.
    A newly created SPL token.

Steps
1. SPL Token Setup

If you haven't done so already, create your SPL token following the guidelines from Lesson Three, and note the address of your SPL token.
2. Update Candy Machine Config

Edit your Candy Machineâ€™s config.json file to update these fields:

    splTokenAccount: Replace with the address of the created SPL token account.
    splToken: Replace with the SPL token address.

3. UI Configuration

Follow the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial to create a UI for your Candy Machine. This UI will allow users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs using the SPL token as payment.
4. Adjust Minting Logic

In your SPL project's minting logic (as outlined in Lesson Three), make the necessary changes to ensure NFTs are minted to the Phantom wallet address. Alternatively, modify the transfer function to deliver minted NFTs directly to the Phantom wallet.
5. Testing

Thoroughly test the entire setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to a Phantom account. Use the UI to mint NFTs, ensuring a smooth process for users paying with the designated SPL token.
